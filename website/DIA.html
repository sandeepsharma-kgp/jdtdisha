                <p>The beneficiaries are young children ranging from 5 to 19 years. They come from rural backgrounds and are mostly exposed to agricultural activity. So Disha uses more than half of it's available 6 acres of land for agriculture. There are more than 2200 trees comprising approximately 90 fruit trees, and 22 vegetables are grown.All the children work in the field for a couple of hours everyday under the supervision of the only gardener, another assistant cum teacher and also a health care worker cum matron at staggered hours throughout the day. The little ones just pick up twigs and clean the ground, the slightly older ones gather leaves for the compost pit and fuel, The still older ones cut grass for the cows food and water the plants. The other older children help with making beds ,preparing the soil and then planting the seeds.</p>
                <p>The children and resident staff are provided with at least 15 Kg of vegetable per day, the endeavor is to grow our own vegetables.This way the children literally partake of the fruits of their own labor it is a financial relief and of course they get freshly plucked produce.</p>
                <p>Disha also has cows that provide milk for the children and some of it is sold to supplement the cost of maintaining the cows. Gobar is used as part of the fertilizer. Some older children help with the daily chores of feeding, milking and cleaning the cowshed.</p>
